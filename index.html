        <h1>Personal Information</h1>
			  <p>My name is Dominic Grkow (s3945746), my email is s3945746@student.rmit.edu.au </p>

        <p>I’m originally from “windy” Wellington, New Zealand in which I lived there for seven years, I am also part Irish, Macedonian and Polish. For a drastic change my family and I moved to Poland 17803 km away, in a small town called Czestochowa were I attended primary school which was a culture shock being used to the laid-back New Zealand lifestyle. I become fluent in Polish but quickly forgot it when we situated to Melbourne, Australia. In which I completed my primary school and secondary college education. </p>

        <p>In the free time I enjoy having a hit of tennis which I have been playing for around ten years, in addition, I’ve played Alto Saxophone since I was 12 years old and studied it in my final year of secondary college which was a challenge during lockdown. </p>
